Research Objectives
1. Compare the contributions of fossil fuel and land use change emissions to national and global warming.

Objective:

To quantify and compare the relative impacts of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from fossil fuel use versus land use changes on national and global warming.
To determine which emission source (fossil fuels or land use changes) has a greater impact on global mean surface temperature (GMST) over time.
Approach:

Develop linear models for GMST response based on emissions from fossil fuels and land use changes.
Compare the coefficients and R-squared values of these models to assess the relative contributions of each emission source.
2. Assess how fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions predict changes in global mean surface temperature.
Objective:

To establish a predictive relationship between annual fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions and changes in GMST.
To quantify the sensitivity of GMST to changes in fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions.
Approach:

Create a linear regression model using fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions as the predictor and GMST change as the response variable.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and interpret the coefficient to understand the magnitude of temperature change associated with a unit change in CO2 emissions.
3. Compare the temperature response to cumulative CO2 emissions with the response from cumulative CH4 and N2O emissions.
Objective:

To evaluate and compare the warming effects of cumulative CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions on GMST.
To determine the relative efficacy of each gas in contributing to global warming, considering their cumulative impacts.
Approach:

Develop separate linear regression models for cumulative emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O with GMST change as the response variable.

Compare the coefficients of these models to determine which gas has the highest warming potential per unit of cumulative emissions.
